Games
> alpha1.1.exe - This is a game that group and I made for a 2 term project for our CI102 and CI103 courses.  It is a puzzle platformer that uses gravity as a way to solve puzzles. Press space to jump and e to fire.  We call it Project Eternal Temple, or PET for short, and we made it on Game Maker Studio.  I did almost all of the art and some of the code with the switches, doors, and gravity.
