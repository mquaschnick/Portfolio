Games
> (Unlisted) SAFE - http://departmentofmediocrevideogames.com/play/
SAFE was a class project for a class that I was not in.  I wanted to learn Unity, and a friend of mine working on the project brought me in as a an extra coder needed for adding in mechanics for the second quater the project was being worked on.  Because of this project I was able to learn the ins and outs of Unity and also learn correct and incorrect ways to plan and write scripts for Unity components.

> GMAP_Drift_Battles.zip - This is a game that a group of 4 students worked on in the last four weeks of Spring 2017 quarter of GMAP 260, Overview of Gaming. It will be a bug themed 2D arena battle game. As lead developer and programmer, I decided to develop this game in Unity, as I have experience with C++ and Java, and thus felt confident in my C# abilities and the tools the engine gives new developers. The game uses a dash mechanic to move (no walking). The two players must build up combos by dashing immediately into another dash. Once the two players collide, a the second phase of the fight initiates (has varied from a button mash push battle to now a grapple and throw where the power is based off the combo). If a player collides into a wall (bug zapper) during the second phase, the game is over and the player that was not zapped by the wall wins. I wrote all scripts and created all the components in Unity, while team members will be providing sprites, animations, UI, music, and sound effects.

> alpha1.1.exe - This is a game that group and I made for a 2 term project for our CI102 and CI103 courses.  It is a puzzle platformer that uses gravity as a way to solve puzzles. Press space to jump and e to fire.  We call it Project Eternal Temple, or PET for short, and we made it on Game Maker Studio.  I did almost all of the art and some of the code with the switches, doors, and gravity.

Code
> autoexec.cfg - This is a automatically executed file for Counter Strike : Global Offensive.  It can be used for executing anything that is a config for the game, but right now I just use it to automatically set "buy binds", while allows me to purchase items in game using my numpad, rather than searching through an in-game "buy menu".
